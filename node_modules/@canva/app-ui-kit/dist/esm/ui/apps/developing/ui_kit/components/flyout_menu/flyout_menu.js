/** 
 * `FlyoutMenu` component that complies with WAI-ARIA patterns and recommendations for menus.
 *
 * It'll automatically manage focus between the trigger and the menu,
 * and will also manage focus when the menu is open, to cycle through
 * the menu items. {@link FlyoutMenuItem}
 *
 * Use `FlyoutMenu` when you need a simple dropdown menu that only contains `FlyoutMenuItem` and `FlyoutMenuDivider`.
 * This component manages its own open/close state and sizes itself based on the menu items,
 * making it perfect for standard menus with consistent behavior and minimal setup.
 *
 * Need more flexibility? Try {@link Flyout} instead.
