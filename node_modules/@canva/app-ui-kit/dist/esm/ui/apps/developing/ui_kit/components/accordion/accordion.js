 * <Accordion>
 * <AccordionItem title="Accordion item title 1">
 *   This is the content of the first accordion item
 * </AccordionItem>
 * <AccordionItem title="Accordion item title 2">
 *   This is the content of the second accordion item

 * <AccordionItem title="Accordion item title 3">
 *   This is the content of the third accordion item
 * </AccordionItem>
