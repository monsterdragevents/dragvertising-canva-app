/** 
 * A component that wraps content to make it scrollable.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Use when you need to make an area within the page independently scrollable,
 * such as paragraphs of long text or a list of items.
 *
 * For cycling through related items like images or slides, consider using `<Carousel/>` instead.
 *
 * Note that Scrollable always takes up 100% of its parent's width and height.
 * To constrain the scroll container's dimensions, wrap it in a `<Box/>` component.
 *
 * @example
 * ```tsx
 * <Box height={200}>
 *   <Scrollable>
 *     <Text>Long scrollable content here...</Text>
 *   </Scrollable>
 * </Box>
 * ```
 *
 * @param props - The component props
 * @returns A JSX element
